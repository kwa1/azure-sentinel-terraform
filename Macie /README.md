Hybrid Cloud Security and Monitoring Solution
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for integrating AWS and Azure Sentinel to achieve cross-cloud security monitoring and sensitive data detection. The solution includes resources for onboarding logs, configuring monitoring agents, and detecting sensitive data using Amazon Macie. Logs and metrics from both environments are forwarded to Azure Sentinel for centralized analysis and alerting.

Features
AWS Integration:

Enable Amazon Macie to detect sensitive data in Amazon S3 buckets.
Onboard AWS logs (CloudWatch) to Azure Sentinel.
Monitor EC2 instances using the CloudWatch Agent.
Azure Integration:

Deploy Azure Sentinel with a Log Analytics Workspace.
Forward logs and metrics from AWS CloudWatch and Macie to Azure Sentinel.
Visualize and analyze security alerts in Sentinel.
Cross-Cloud Security Monitoring:

Aggregate logs and metrics from AWS and Azure environments.
Provide actionable insights using Azure Sentinel dashboards and alerts.
Architecture
The solution uses the following resources:

AWS
Amazon S3: Stores application logs and sensitive data.
Amazon Macie: Detects and classifies sensitive data in S3 buckets.
CloudWatch Logs: Collects system logs, application logs, and Macie findings.
CloudWatch Agent: Collects metrics and system logs from EC2 instances.
AWS Lambda: Forwards logs from CloudWatch to Azure Sentinel.
Azure
Log Analytics Workspace: Collects and stores logs from various sources.
Azure Sentinel: Analyzes logs for security insights and generates alerts.
Prerequisites
AWS:

An active AWS account.
Access to IAM, S3, CloudWatch, and Macie.
An S3 bucket for storing logs.
CloudWatch Agent installed on EC2 instances (if applicable).
Azure:

An active Azure subscription.
Access to Log Analytics and Sentinel.
Terraform:

Terraform installed for infrastructure automation.
Python:

Python runtime for AWS Lambda (if you want to customize the log forwarding function).
Deployment
1. Deploy AWS Resources
Use the Terraform scripts in the aws folder to deploy AWS resources:

Configure your AWS CLI and set up credentials.
Update the terraform.tfvars file with your values.
Initialize and deploy the resources:
bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
This will deploy:

An S3 bucket.
Amazon Macie for sensitive data detection.
CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Agent for EC2 monitoring.
A Lambda function to forward logs to Azure Sentinel.
2. Deploy Azure Resources
Use the Terraform scripts in the azure folder to deploy Azure resources:

Configure your Azure CLI and authenticate with your subscription.
Update the terraform.tfvars file with your values.
Initialize and deploy the resources:
bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
This will deploy:

An Azure Resource Group.
A Log Analytics Workspace.
Azure Sentinel configured with the workspace.
3. Configure Log Forwarding
Update the AWS Lambda function (function_app/__init__.py) with the Azure Sentinel Workspace ID and Shared Key.
Deploy the Lambda function using the provided Terraform scripts or manually through the AWS Console.
Usage
Monitor Logs in Azure Sentinel:

Navigate to your Azure Sentinel instance in the Azure Portal.
View ingested logs from AWS, including CloudWatch Logs and Macie findings.
Analyze data with built-in dashboards or custom queries in Log Analytics.
Sensitive Data Detection:

View Macie findings in AWS.
Forward sensitive data findings to Azure Sentinel for centralized monitoring.
Dashboards and Alerts:

Create custom dashboards and alerts in Azure Sentinel for proactive security monitoring.

Best Practices
AWS Macie:

Regularly review findings for sensitive data.
Apply bucket policies to restrict access to sensitive S3 data.
Azure Sentinel:

Create alert rules to detect suspicious activity.
Use threat intelligence feeds to enhance alerting capabilities.
Cross-Cloud Monitoring:

Periodically test the integration to ensure logs are correctly ingested.
Leverage dashboards for real-time insights into security events.
